### Prerequisites

Install the [Expo](https://expo.io/) client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the Camera app.


## Running the app on a simulator or virtual device

Expo CLI allows you to run your React Native app on a physical device without setting up a development environment.
